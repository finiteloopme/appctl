# Overview

Platforms are created to allow developers and application owners to focus on the application and abstract away the underlying infrastructure.  This abstraction via a platform allows the underlying technology stack to be swapped out with a newer version technology framework or even a completely different framework.  And this is essential to scale and effectively manage the technology stack required by the engineering function.
